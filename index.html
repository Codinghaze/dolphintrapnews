      <h3>‘SOTC’ to Strike Monday Night</h3>
      <p class="bold-lead">(So-Tock) Officially Declared “Storm of the Century” by… Zach</p>
      <p><strong>OSHKOSH, WI</strong> — Batten down the hatches, secure your lawn flamingos, and kiss your outdoor furniture goodbye — the <em>Storm of the Century</em> (SOTC) is scheduled to arrive Monday night with enough force to mess up your Netflix queue and your neighbor's trampoline.</p>
      <p>Local dad and amateur meteorologist Zachary Dewitt-Moran, who first coined the term SOTC while laughing too hard at his own jokes, was quoted saying,</p>
      <p class="quote">“It’s definitely gonna be the Storm of the Century… unless there’s a worse one later, in which case this will be retroactively downgraded to 'Storm of the Fiscal Quarter.'”</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service, while unable to verify Zach’s authority on storm naming, did acknowledge the incoming system as “pretty slick.”</p>
      <p>Residents are advised to stock up on flashlights, canned goods, and a suspicious amount of Diet Coke.</p>

      <p>This is the first year it's ever been called before Mother's Day.</p>
