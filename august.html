      <h3>HERO BARTENDER SAVES PATRON FROM ESCAPED GORILLA</h3>
      <p class="bold-lead">Sherrytown Station Staff Member Becomes Local Legend After Thursday Night Incident</p>
      <p><strong>NEENAH, WI</strong> — In what witnesses are calling "the most action-packed happy hour in Neenah history," a quick-thinking bartender at Sherrytown Station successfully protected a customer from Mick the Gorilla, who had escaped from Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary earlier that evening.</p>
      <p>The 400-pound silverback somehow made his way to the popular watering hole around 10:30 PM Thursday, drawn by what zoo officials believe was "the unmistakable sound of clinking glasses and good times."</p>
      <p class="quote">"I looked up from making a Old Fashioned and there's this massive gorilla just staring at my customer through the window. Without thinking, I shielded the poor helpless customer and punched the gorilla square in her jaw. Mick seemed confused by my technique, which gave us time to get everyone to safety."</p>
      <p>The unidentified patron, who was reportedly "tweleve beers deep into discussing the various employement opportunities," initially mistook Mick for "a really hairy regular" until the gorilla began beating on him in what appeared to be either a territorial display or appreciation for the establishment's craft beer selection.</p>
      <p>Mick was safely returned to the sanctuary the following morning after spending the night peacefully eating bar snacks he found in the alley behind the building.</p>

      <h3>LOCAL MAN JACOB MILING STILL MISSING FROM FAMILY FUNCTIONS</h3>
      <p class="bold-lead">24-Year-Old's Two-Year Absence from Cookouts Sparks Community-Wide Search</p>
      <p><strong>NEENAH, WI</strong> — Family members are growing increasingly concerned about Jacob Miling, 24, who hasn't been spotted at a single family gathering, cookout, birthday party, or holiday celebration in nearly two years.</p>
      <p class="quote">"We've tried everything — we've saved him spots at the picnic table, made extra potato salad, even bought his drink (Kinky Vodka). But he's like a ghost. A ghost who apparently has better things to do than visit his in-laws"</p>
      <p>Search efforts have expanded beyond traditional family events to include discord groups,  and even casual facebook stalking. Some family members have reported brief Jacob sightings on rust or minecraft, but these remain unverified.</p>
      <p>The Moran family is offering a reward of one full plate of leftovers and first dibs on dessert for any information leading to Jacob's attendance at the upcoming Labor Day cookout.</p>
      <p>Jacob could not be reached for comment, which family members say is "completely typical of him lately."</p>

      <h3>3-Year-Old BENNET PURCHASES FIRST HOME</h3>
      <p class="bold-lead">Local Toddler Becomes Youngest Homeowner in County History with Bounce House Investment</p>
      <p><strong>NEENAH, WI</strong> — In a move that has stunned local real estate professionals, 3-year-old Bennet successfully purchased his first home this week — a spacious 12x12 bounce house that he's already moved into</p>
      <p>The transaction was completed using Bennet's life savings, which reportedly consisted of birthday money from three different relatives, coins found under couch cushions, and what appears to be Monopoly money that somehow passed through escrow.</p>
      <p class="quote">"When we asked Bennet for a comment about his new purchase, he shouted 'BOUNCE HOUSE!' and immediately ran back inside to continue what appeared to be a very serious bouncing session."</p>
      <p>The bounce house features an open floor plan and 360-degree views.</p>
       <p>When asked about his future real estate plans, Bennet simply pointed to a trampoline catalog and grinned.</p>
